# Changelog

## 0.3.1

- Fixed the web client plugin never activating on current DSH hosts — the web
  UI showed `dsh-tabbit: pending (waiting for service: conversationEvents)`.
  The DSH client runtime refactor (already part of `0.1.2-alpha.1`) renamed the
  `conversationEvents` service to `uiConversation` and moved node registration
  from `service.register()` to `service.events.register()`. The client plugin
  now injects `uiConversation`; the `/tabbit-info` status card, the `@tab`
  composer source, and the watching-instance hint all had been blocked behind
  that pending inject and work again. The `conversation.chat.node` keyed slot
  registration and the Definition contract (`match`/`start`/`update`/
  `buildViewNode`) are unchanged.

## 0.3.0

- Major upgrade: browser automation now runs through the native
  `tabbit_browser` tool — real Playwright code executing in the user's Tabbit
  Browser profile with shared login state, screenshots into model context,
  automatic interruption recovery, and multi-instance resolution — plus a
  browser-backed `web_fetch` provider, `@tab` page mentions in the dsh web
  composer, a dedicated page-access permission, and a `/tabbit` diagnostics
  command. The bundled skill now teaches the tool workflow instead of the
  `tabbit-cli` shell workflow. Requires Node 22.19 or newer (was 20).
- Adopted the renamed `tabbit-cli` launcher that current Tabbit Browser
  builds register (with fallback to the legacy `tabbit-playwright` name), and
  the per-instance `.product` labels in the instance registry.
- New model-free tab inventory: `ctx.tabbit.listAllTabs()` and the loopback
  route `GET /tabbit/tabs` list every tab of the running browser profile
  (including the user's own tabs) by talking to the Runtime Service endpoint
  directly — no launcher process, no task, no side effects, ~1ms steady-state.
  Requires a 1.11.16+ Tabbit Browser; the browser is never launched for a
  listing, offline instances report as unavailable instead.
- The `@` mention menu in the dsh web composer now lists the user's own
  browser tabs alongside agent task pages (active tab first; only http(s)
  pages are offered, since chrome://, extension, and blank/new-tab pages
  cannot deliver content when mentioned), under a "网页标签" group shown
  below DSH's built-in file/session mentions, with up to 50 candidates
  instead of 8. Mentioning a user tab fetches a fresh copy of that URL's
  content through the shared browser fetch task — the user's actual tab is
  never claimed, moved, or focused. The extracted page text no longer lands
  in the sent message itself: the composer sends a short `@Title` mention,
  and the full text is delivered to the model as a separate, collapsed
  "Context injection" entry via an `agent/pre-step` hook — the same delivery
  path DSH's own `@file`/`@session` mentions use — so a mentioned page's
  content never floods the visible chat bubble. `tabbit_browser` gained
  `list_tabs: true` for the model-facing version of the same inventory, paired
  with `claim_tabs` to attach a specific user tab to a new task.
- Windows support: the launcher is discovered under
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Tabbit\LocalAgent\bin\tabbit-cli.exe`, instance selection
  defers to the native CLI when the instance registry is not readable, and the
  environment preflight falls back to runtime-process detection.
- The environment preflight (`tabbit_browser_install`), the daily plugin
  update check, and the `tabbit_plugin_update` tool carry over from 0.2.x.
  The update check now reads the npm registry for the latest version (with
  release notes served from the published tarball), and stays silent for
  browser-managed (preinstalled) copies, which update together with Tabbit
  Browser.
- The bundled skill gained references for the runtime interaction helpers
  (`tabbit.observe`, `pasteText`, `triggerAndObserve`, …) and AI-mode ARIA
  snapshot recipes for canvas-backed and visually complex surfaces. It is now
  named `tabbit`, deliberately matching the shared skill Tabbit Browser
  installs into `~/.agents/skills/tabbit/`: DSH's same-name precedence
  prefers that browser-managed copy, and the bundled one is the fallback for
  machines without a current browser. The `/tabbit` diagnostics command was
  renamed to `/tabbit-info` to leave the `/tabbit` slash entry to the skill.
- Task finishing adapted to the new runtime semantics (plain `finish` now
  retains tabs as a resumable group): the plugin always passes an explicit
  `--keep` or `--discard`, which behaves correctly on both CLI generations,
  so `finish` without `keep_tabs` and end-of-session cleanup reliably close
  task tabs.
- DSH `0.1.2-alpha.1` also ships its own direct-HTTP `web_fetch` provider and
  pins the `web` service to it; the bundle patch now re-pins `fetchProvider`
  to this plugin's browser-backed provider, keeping JS rendering, login
  state, the page-access/intranet permission gates, and the browser's proxy
  environment (the built-in fetcher connects directly to resolved public IPs
  and refuses every domain on fake-ip proxy setups).
- Requires DSH `0.1.2-alpha.1` or newer, whose standard agent preset ships
  with `web_fetch` enabled — the bundled "Tabbit mode" preset is gone, and
  plugin activation removes a previously installed managed copy (marker
  protocol respected: user-owned copies are never touched).

## 0.2.3

- Fixed the bundle's `cordis.patch.yml` loader entry to use the npm package
  name `dsh-tabbit` instead of the non-existent package `tabbit-browser`. This
  resolves the `Cannot find package 'tabbit-browser'` load failure that
  affected fresh installs after the package was renamed in 0.2.1.

## 0.2.2

- Install and update commands now use the npm package (`dsh plugin add
  dsh-tabbit`) as the primary route — prebuilt tarball, CDN-served, and
  counted in npm download stats; the `github:` source remains documented as
  a fallback.

## 0.2.1

- Renamed the package to `dsh-tabbit` and published it to npm; updated all
  remaining references (daily update-check changelog URL, install commands in
  the plugin, skill, and READMEs) from `Tabbit-Browser/dsh-plugin` to
  `Tabbit-Browser/dsh-tabbit`.

## 0.2.0

- Added a daily plugin update check. Loading the skill compares the installed
  plugin version with the published changelog — cached for 24 hours, at most
  one request per day, silent when offline — and, when outdated, asks the user
  whether to update, showing what the new version added.
- Added the `tabbit_plugin_update` tool. It records a version the user declined
  so the skill stops announcing it, and can force a recheck after a plugin
  update or a connectivity change.
